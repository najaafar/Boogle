                "title" : "Several GREAT novellas in one very long book!",
                "content" : "<span class='a-size-base review-text'>I won't go into the plot since everyone will know it. My concern whenever I'm given or purchase a very long book is, 'Will it keep me engaged?' and is it worth the weeks it will take me to finish it?'<br/><br/>The answer with THE GOLDFINCH is 'Yes!' and 'Sorta!'<br/><br/>To me, the book is divided into sections or novellas--the explosion, living with the wealthy family, moving to Vegas, etc.<br/><br/>The brilliant opening section immediately kept me engaged--I think the explosion and Theo's experience and recovery is some of the best writing I've read in years.<br/><br/>The family he moves in with may remind you of THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS or Salinger's Glass family. They are funny, a bit tragic and sort of odd. The father especially--something about his behavior seemed a bit 'off' as did his wild dialogue; it didn't seem at all 'real' in a novel that's very grounded in reality. (It's revealed later why he behaves this way.)<br/><br/>The next--and for me, strongest novella--takes place in Las Vegas where we 'live' with Theo's father and girlfriend. The writing is vivid, the characters and plot really move along and it's all terrific.<br/><br/>And then, for me, THE GOLDFINCH seems to stall a bit and slightly loses its way. This painting that Theo carries with him seems to be forgotten about and then every 100 pages or so is mentioned again (not that we care.)<br/><br/>There's a novella about dealing in art (collection and deception) and our hero takes a downward turn, but I found myself losing interest and by page 600 was growing impatient for it to end...or for the plot to kick in again as it did in the first few sections.<br/><br/>The great thing about this book is that you can set it aside for a few days and pick it up again and not be 'lost'--the writing and characters are that strong. The 'plot' on the other hand seems to grow thinner and less important as you head down the last 200 plus pages as 'big issues' are thoughtfully woven in.<br/><br/>I'm sure this will receive many 4 and 5 star ratings, but I'm giving it a very good solid 3 since, unfortunately, it seemed to run out of gas toward the end. But those first 600 pages -- great, great stuff!</span>"

                "title" : "Some great scenes and lines that don't add up",
                "content" : "<span class='a-size-base review-text'>It's been a long time since I found a book so alternately beautiful and maddening. There are excellent scenes and lines in this novel, and I'm glad I read it, but it doesn't hold together well. In the end it reminded me of the antique shop the character Hobie runs in the book: many amazing, high-quality things half-hidden beneath mounds of less interesting stuff.<br/><br/>Tartt deserves credit for daring greatly in this book. It's hard to center a long novel on a fairly unlikeable character, and even harder when that character is also the narrator. In Theo Decker I felt she was trying to get at the ways a severe psychic injury plays out over a lifetime, and for the first half of the book I was fascinated by Theo even when I didn't like him. And Tartt does lay the groundwork carefully for his later misdeeds, particularly in Theo's unwanted resemblance to his father. But once Theo becomes an adult (in years if not in maturity), he makes so many stupid decisions, and is so apathetic about his life generally, that it got increasingly difficult for me to care what happened to him. It's also hard to reconcile how Theo can act as he does while having the insights he articulates. I understand that this is part of what Tartt is trying to explore (why people don't do what they know, at some level, they should do), but I don't think it quite comes off here. Theo's character felt too inconsistent to sustain the whole novel.<br/><br/>The high points of the novel for me were Theo's life immediately after the explosion that kills his mother, when he is taken in by the wealthy family of a school friend, and his relationship with Hobie, the furniture dealer who takes him on as a kind of apprentice. As in 'The Secret History,' Tartt excels in showing the dark underside of wealth and privilege, and it wasn't a surprise when members of the wealthy family turn up later in Theo's life and play some decisive roles. As for Hobie, I wanted to read a whole novel about him, because the portions that describe his sense for furniture and his love for the past were some of the strongest in the book. Boris, the Russian-born friend Theo makes during his sojourn in Las Vegas with his gambler father, is also a vivid character, and I appreciated that Tartt took his character in directions I didn't expect.<br/><br/>It's the ending (and by 'ending' I mean about the last 200 pages) that was the real problem for me. The violence and cross-continents chase scenes just didn't ring true. This part of the book, in which more 'happens' in plot terms, was actually the hardest to get through. Tartt excels at rendering the inner lives of characters, but the action scenes fall flat.<br/><br/>I hate giving this novel a mediocre rating, because I appreciate the ambition it embodies and the parts of it in which Tartt's prose really sings. She's engaging some important questions about the power of art in this book, and the scenes that feature Theo thinking through his relationship with the purloined painting were moving and thought-provoking. The novel as a whole just doesn't measure up to its best components, sadly.</span>"

                "title" : "A stunning success, one of the most striking novels I have read in years",
                "content" : "<span class='a-size-base review-text'>I passed the Metropolitan Museum of Art the other day and was struck with a powerful and initially inexplicable melancholy. I had been affected by the experience of reading The Goldfinch, in the opening chapters of which a great tragedy happens there. The book is compelling and moving. Tartt is a master of foreshadowing, letting us know just enough of what is to come that we feel helpless to put down the book. I found myself staying up late for several nights, turning page after page to connect the dots. This book is every bit the equal of <a class='a-link-normal' href='/The-Secret-History/dp/1400031702'>The Secret History</a> in this regard. And it exceeds that earlier book in its great emotional depth. The opening section, in New York City, is terribly sad and in the hands of a lesser author this material would be difficult to get past. However, Tartt has signaled us well enough about the future of our protagonist, Theodore Dekker, that we stick with him. And from the second section of the book, while we have no shortage of continuing misery, it is tempered by hope or humor.<br/><br/>This is not to say that the book is necessarily realistic; it is structurally a Bildungsroman, and it constantly evokes earlier books rather than real life.  In the opening section, when Theo is still living in New York City, I particularly detected <a class='a-link-normal' href='/The-Catcher-in-the-Rye/dp/0316769487'>The Catcher in the Rye</a>. When he moves in with the family of a wealthy school friend, his hope of being adopted by them evokes elements of <a class='a-link-normal' href='/Great-Expectations/dp/0486415864'>Great Expectations</a>, a book that is recalled again when he returns to them over a decade later to find the matron of the family shut away like Miss Havisham (though for very different reasons). He is taken away to Las Vegas and falls in with a bad crowd, evoking <a class='a-link-normal' href='/Oliver-Twist/dp/0486424537'>Oliver Twist</a>. As in that book, the reader understands that some of this crowd provide necessary support for the young man. Theo returns to New York and, years later, finds himself exploring dark places with Boris, his criminally inclined Las Vegas friend, following the trail of a missing painting. This reminded me of the best work of <a class='a-link-normal' href='/Stephen-Dobyns/dp/0140121552'>Stephen Dobyns</a>. Some parts of the book even recall <a class='a-link-normal' href='/The-Maltese-Falcon/dp/0679722645'>The Maltese Falcon</a>, though the book treats its namesake artwork as more than merely a MacGuffin. Others will find different precedents, I'm sure. This book is long and rich.<br/><br/>Tartt took over a decade to write The Goldfinch, and polished its language over that time. In Las Vegas, for example, Theo describes his new quarters as 'the kind of room where a call girl or stewardess would be murdered on television.' Tartt has so much fun with the speaking cadence of drunk Russians (or Ukranians), I have to imagine she spends a fair amount of time with Slavs. Dialect humor is rare nowadays, but here it is done with such love that it's inoffensive and often quite funny.<br/><br/>I've not spent time in the failed housing developments at the extremes of Las Vegas, nor with Ukrainian drug dealers, but Tartt portrays these worlds so vividly I don't doubt her depictions of them at all. The quality of the plotting, the characterizations, and the dialog in this book are consistently excellent. As Stephen King wrote of The Goldfinch in the New York Times Book Review, 'You keep waiting for the wheels to fall off, but . . . they never do.'<br/><br/>What's not so perfect? Though Tartt captures the subtleties of several different kinds of relationships between men, much better than I would have thought possible for a female author, the relationships between Theo Dekker and women never quite ring true. One may give the excuse that Theo is so damaged by the loss of his mother that he is never again capable of normal relationships with the opposite sex, but I think this explanation takes one only so far.<br/><br/>The passages in which Theo crams for university entrance exams seem hard to believe and, oddly for a tome like this, rushed.<br/><br/>Finally, and this is not Tartt's fault, I'm sure, the paper in the hardcover edition is too thin. I suspect the publisher winced at receiving an 800 page manuscript and decided to print on thin paper in the hope of creating a less intimidating volume on bookstore shelves. When reading page 403, you have to ignore the backwards shadow of the words on page 404, overleaf.<br/><br/>Tartt tackles broad themes in this book: to what degree can we control our fate? Or does life unspool in response only to forces beyond our control, including randomness? These are common enough topics for novelists, and I found myself dwelling particularly on some of the book's secondary themes, as they are less commonly discussed. Can humans create objects that have souls, and what obligation do we have to our creations, and is there any meaningful way in which artifacts make life worth living? What is the significance of authenticity, and can a copy ever be as significant as the original? Can we be moved sometimes by the absence of something as much as we would have been by its presence? In a profile of Tartt on October 21, the New York Times said that this book raises such questions as 'whether it is possible to be good, what part love plays in our behavior and what in life is true and lasting.'<br/><br/>It's a wonderful book, worth every penny and every hour needed to read it.</span>"

                "title" : "From a teen-age survivor",
                "content" : "<span class='a-size-base review-text'>I am not quite finished with the book, but so far, I think it is very well written. It covers a topic that is difficult to talk about and is often avoided. It has been challenging for me to get through; however, I feel like I should add my perspective. I was diagnosed with cancer at 10. I am now 15 years old and a teen-age cancer survivor. I am a volunteer and advocate for pediatric cancer awareness.<br/><br/>This book has gotten negative reviews based on several points:<br/>1) This is from another reviewer: 'The characters are not believable. They do not speak like teenagers. They do not even handle situations like teenagers do. So many interactions between Gus and Hazel are interactions which, plain and simple, just would not happen between real, emotional, scared, awkward, virgin teenagers, let alone ones with cancer who have been socially cut off for much of their lives.'<br/><br/>*My point-of-view: Have you spent time with any of us? They are believable as teen-age cancer patients/survivors. We may look like teen-agers, but in our heads, we are not. We have had to face our own mortality and make choices we should never have to make. It makes us grow up...quickly. Most of us do not act or speak like teen-agers because that is no longer how we think. After treatment, many of us find the things most teens (and sometimes adults) are worried about are trivial. Society cuts us off, but we are not cut off from each other. These types of interactions do happen. And, it is emotional and scary, but we learn to tell it like it is, without the normal fluff and awkwardness. We find 'normal' where we can and try to live every single day we have because we know that time is an illusion.<br/><br/>2) The parents are not real, not deep characters, and they do not have their own identities.<br/><br/>*My point-of-view: I have seen my own parents (and siblings) and the parents of other friends struggle with this. Many times, they do not have their own identities anymore. Every single minute is spent trying to make it to the next! They try to keep the family together and functioning, in spite of the effects of treatment, fevers and midnight trips to the emergency room, 3 weeks of the month spent in isolation, jobs in jeopardy, birthdays and holidays interrupted, not to mention talks that parents never want to have with their child. I've talked to my mom about this. This becomes their identity. My mom said their jobs become about doing whatever it takes, travelling all over the country (which is very common), researching new studies, and new medicines, all to help us survive and thrive with grace and dignity. It is also their job to prepare, if treatments don't work, to help us die with just as much grace and dignity.<br/><br/>I hope everyone can read this with an open mind and an open heart. Then, reach out to the patients and survivors in your communities. They are wise beyond their years, funny, brave and inspiring.</span>"

I'll make it simple; I'm a fifteen year old teenage boy. When I usually read a book, I toss it aside and move on to the next one. And, like most teenage boys, I am not very emotional. At the end of this book, I cried. Not just a few tears either; I was full on bawling my eyes out. That's how good this book is. I promise you, unless you have a heart of stone, you will love this book.</span>"

                "title" : "Young Adult Fiction at its finest",
                "content" : "<span class='a-size-base review-text'>Although his brother Hank might argue that the real 'fault in our stars' is that our sun contains limited amounts of hydrogen, which will cause it to eventually run out of the only fuel source capable of supporting its mass against gravity, thereby expanding until its outer shell envelops our tiny planet and consumes it in a fiery death, I think it is more likely that John Green's title refers to a line from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar:<br/><br/>'The fault, dear Brutus is not in our stars, / But in ourselves, that we are underlings.' Caesar (I, ii, 140-141)<br/><br/>What does this quote mean and how does it relate to a novel about two kids dying of cancer?  I'll explore that below.<br/><br/>The Fault in Our Stars is the story of two 16-year-olds who meet at a cancer support group.  Hazel Lancaster, the narrator, is afflicted with terminal thyroid cancer which has ravaged her lungs enough to necessitate the use of an oxygen tank wherever she goes.  It is during a support meeting that she is introduced to Augustus Waters, whose leg was claimed by a malignant bone tumor and who soon becomes the object of her affection.<br/><br/>When I learned of the plot of this novel, I was initially a bit turned off.  I'm reminded of a comment a friend made when I asked her if she wanted to go see the movie <a class='a-link-normal' href='/50-50/dp/B004QL7KKC'>50/50</a>, upon which she exclaimed 'who wants to go see a movie about people dying of cancer?'  I couldn't come up with a satisfactory response, and we settled for a two-hour movie about the competitive world of robot fighting (which still caused me to shed a tear).  So why would anyone, especially young adults, want to read about 'cancer kids?'  As Hazel herself states in the novel, 'cancer books suck.'  But 'The Fault in Our Stars' isn't about cancer, and it's not about death.  Cancer is an important subject in the book, but it's not nearly as important as the characters. The disease is mainly used as a vehicle for moving along the development of Hazel and Augustus. In the absence of teen wizards, dystopian death races, and swooning vampire/werewolf feuds, it allows us to view the protagonists in a more complex setting than the traditional high school drama.  It also forces the characters to grow up much faster than they should, which I think is important for Green's audience as well as his needs as a writer.  The 'young adult' label should not be cause for dismissal to older audiences.  As equally evident in his previous novels, Green's writing is not dumbed-down in an attempt to cater to a misguided adult notion of the intelligence of teenagers. While Hazel and Augustus certainly share in the same adolescent interests as many of their peers, their dialogue is written at a level that betrays a deeper level of maturity.  Amidst trips to the mall and countless video game sessions, the characters expound on subjects in life that everyone faces.  While it might seem strange to hear a 16-year-old use words like 'cloying' and 'sobriquet,' this is par for the course in a John Green novel.  And strangely, it works very well (provided you keep a dictionary handy).  Even though I initially balked at reading a 'young adult' title (I'm well into adulthood), I realized that just because a book is marketed toward adolescents, doesn't mean it can't be enjoyed by those outside that niche.  I'm hesitant to make the comparison, but 'The Fault in our Stars' bridges the age gap in the same vein as Salinger's <a class='a-link-normal' href='/The-Catcher-in-the-Rye/dp/0316769177'>The Catcher in the Rye</a>.  It contains content and themes thoroughly relatable to a young audience, while being presented in a way that adults will appreciate.<br/><br/>Green's characters always come off a bit stiff to me and start off sounding like pretentious jerks who are trying too hard to grow up, but I always warm up to them and end up relating to them by the middle of the novel.  Gus was no exception. However my opinion of him changed as early as chapter 2, and I knew as soon as I heard him have a conversation with Hazel about their counselor's incorrect usage of the word 'literally' (a fact that had literally been bothering me since it was mentioned in the first chapter) that I knew we could be friends.  The likeability factor of these characters is one of the reasons the rest of the story can be so heartbreaking to follow at times.  Even though I was fully aware from the beginning that Hazel's condition is terminal, she doesn't behave in a way that constantly reminds me of that fact.  Instead, her sarcastic wit and outlook on life draw me to her as someone I could easily be friends with (if only there wasn't that problem of her being a fictional character).  From very early on, I'm sucked into an emotional attachment to the characters in the story that made it very difficult to actually put the book down (and one of the reasons I will probably read it several more times).  Returning to the titular quote above, although it is fully explained in the novel, I think the line from Julius Caesar is also appropriate as a title because Hazel does not let her ultimate fate determine the course of her life.<br/><br/>I thought Green's last two solo books, Katherines and Paper Towns, were pretty good, but they didn't capture that sense of awe I felt after finishing his first novel.  And again, I think that's because I've seen such a huge change over the years in Green's ability to connect his characters to the reader.  The Fault in our Stars returns me to that era and I'm reminded of just how good of a writer he is.  I do not know if it will win the same Young Adult Fiction awards Alaska received, but I do know it will be regarded by myself and many more as one of, if not his best work to date.  Regardless of their literary interests, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of great writing and character-driven stories.<br/><br/>It should also be mentioned that Green personally signed all 150,000 copies of the first printing of this novel. So if you are buying it soon after release, your copy will almost certainly be autographed.<br/><br/>John Green's other novels include:<br/><br/><a class='a-link-normal' href='/Looking-for-Alaska/dp/0142402516'>Looking for Alaska</a> (2005)<br/><a class='a-link-normal' href='/An-Abundance-of-Katherines/dp/0142410705'>An Abundance of Katherines</a> (2006)<br/><a class='a-link-normal' href='/Paper-Towns/dp/014241493X'>Paper Towns</a> (2008)<br/><a class='a-link-normal' href='/Let-It-Snow-Three-Holiday-Romances/dp/0142414999'>Let It Snow: Three Holiday Romances</a> (coauthored - 2010)<br/><a class='a-link-normal' href='/Will-Grayson-Will-Grayson/dp/0142418471'>Will Grayson, Will Grayson</a> (coauthored - 2010)<br/><br/>DFTBA</span>"
